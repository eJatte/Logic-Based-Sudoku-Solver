Solves sudoku puzzles using only logic, no bruteforce. Also outputs step by step solution.

This solver may not be able to solve all logic based sudoku puzzles. This is because the logic it uses is only what i came up with and there most likely exist more techniques out there.

It does however solve most evil level puzzles i have tested.
